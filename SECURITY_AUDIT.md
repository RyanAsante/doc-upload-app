# Security Audit Report - VaultDrop Application

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the VaultDrop application to protect against common web application vulnerabilities and ensure secure operation.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **Admin Authentication**: Secure cookie-based authentication with HTTP-only, secure, and same-site flags
- ✅ **Manager Authentication**: Role-based access control with approved status verification
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Secure login with bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ **Route Protection**: Middleware-based route protection for all sensitive endpoints
- ✅ **Session Management**: Configurable session timeouts with automatic logout

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- ✅ **Email Validation**: Strict email format validation using regex patterns
- ✅ **Password Strength**: Comprehensive password requirements (length, complexity, special characters)
- ✅ **File Type Validation**: Whitelist-based file type validation with MIME type checking
- ✅ **File Header Validation**: Magic byte validation to prevent file type spoofing

### 3. File Upload Security
- ✅ **File Size Limits**: Maximum file size of 100MB to prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ **File Type Restrictions**: Only images and videos allowed (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, MP4, WebM, OGG, QuickTime)
- ✅ **Secure Storage**: Files stored in Supabase with signed URLs and 7-day expiry
- ✅ **Filename Sanitization**: Special characters removed from filenames
- ✅ **Content Validation**: File content validation using magic bytes

### 4. API Security
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP address
- ✅ **CSRF Protection**: CSRF token generation and validation
- ✅ **Secure Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including CSP, XSS protection, frame options
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validate and sanitize inputs

### 5. Database Security
- ✅ **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database queries preventing SQL injection
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Strict role-based permissions (CUSTOMER, MANAGER, ADMIN)
- ✅ **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all user actions
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Database-level constraints and validation

### 6. Infrastructure Security
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: All external URLs must use HTTPS
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: Required environment variables validated at startup
- ✅ **Production Hardening**: Source maps disabled, powered-by header removed
- ✅ **Cookie Security**: Secure, HTTP-only cookies with appropriate flags
- ✅ **CORS Protection**: Strict same-origin policy enforcement

### 7. Session Security
- ✅ **Secure Cookies**: HTTP-only, secure, same-site cookies
- ✅ **Session Timeouts**: Automatic session expiration (24h admin, 7d manager)
- ✅ **Logout Functionality**: Secure logout with cookie clearing
- ✅ **Session Isolation**: Separate sessions for different user types

## Security Headers Implemented

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: comprehensive CSP with strict defaults
```

## Rate Limiting Configuration

- **General API**: 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Login Attempts**: 5 attempts before lockout (15-minute duration)
- **File Uploads**: Size and count limits per user
- **Admin Operations**: Rate limited to prevent abuse

## File Upload Security

### Allowed File Types
- **Images**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Videos**: MP4, WebM, OGG, QuickTime

### Security Measures
- File size limit: 100MB
- File type validation (MIME + extension + magic bytes)
- Filename sanitization
- Secure storage with signed URLs
- 7-day URL expiry for security

## Password Security Requirements

- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Must contain: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- Bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- No password reuse allowed

## Authentication Flow Security

1. **User Registration**: Input validation → password hashing → user creation
2. **User Login**: Credential verification → session creation → secure cookie
3. **Manager Login**: Role verification → status check → session management
4. **Admin Login**: Password verification → secure session → route protection

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

- ✅ **SQL Injection**: Prevented by Prisma ORM and parameterized queries
- ✅ **XSS Attacks**: Prevented by input sanitization and CSP headers
- ✅ **CSRF Attacks**: Prevented by CSRF tokens and same-site cookies
- ✅ **File Upload Vulnerabilities**: Prevented by comprehensive file validation
- ✅ **Session Hijacking**: Prevented by secure cookies and session management
- ✅ **Brute Force Attacks**: Prevented by rate limiting and account lockout
- ✅ **Information Disclosure**: Prevented by generic error messages
- ✅ **Directory Traversal**: Prevented by input sanitization and validation
- ✅ **Clickjacking**: Prevented by X-Frame-Options header
- ✅ **MIME Type Spoofing**: Prevented by magic byte validation
